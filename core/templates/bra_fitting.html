        <p>Welcome! We are excited to be assisting you in your bra fitting today. Our goal is to teach you how to find a bra that gives you the support you want.</p>
        <i>There is one out there and we will give you the information that you need in order to find it.</i>

            <div class="hvrbox-layer-top">
                <p class="hover-text">First, what is a bra size? A bra size is usually shown as two numbers followed by a letter. The two numbers represent a band size and the letter represents a cup size. There are a few steps that we will take to get these values. Yes, calculations are involved. Yes, measurements are involved. These measurements are taken so you can find the bra size that will give you the most support. These measurements do not define how amazing you are or your value as a person (that value is uncalculateable because you are too awesome for numbers!).

            <div class="hvrbox-layer-top">
                <p class="hover-text">So I will do everything to make this a safe and fun bra fitting experience for you. In order to do that you need to be as comfortable as you can be. So go put on your most comfy t-shirt. If you have a bra you are more than welcome to wear one for the fitting. If you don't have a bra, no worries, that doesn't impact the fitting one bit!

            <div class="hvrbox-layer-top">
                <p class="hover-text">Next we need to get a few other materials to help with the fitting process...
                <ul class="fit-materials-list">
                    <li>Measuring tape. I suggest a embroidery tape measure. If you dont have one grab a long peice of string or yarn, some scissors and a ruler.</li>
                    <li>Optional: A mirror. You may find it helpful to get your best measurements if you have a mirror as your guide. If that is uncomfortable for you, then dont use a mirror. You can do the measurements without one. 
                </ul>
                Now that you have all materials gathered that you want, let us take sec to prepare for the fitting.

        <h3 id="band-measurement-wearing-label">Band Measurement</h3>
        <div class="form-question-info">This is not your band <i>size</i>. Crazy right! Bra fitting is a funny thing indeed because a band size is actually calculated by adding a few more inches to your band measurement.<br>
        This number is a tool to find your best support not a definition of who you are!
        </div>
        <div class="fitting-block">

        </div>
        <ul class="fit-materials-list">
            <li>If your band measurement was an odd number we will add <strong>5</strong> inches to get your band size.</li>
            <li>If your band measurement was and even number we will add <strong>4</strong> inches to get your band measurement.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="fitting-step step-three">
        <h3 id="bust-measurement-wearing-label">Bust Measurement</h3>
        <div class="form-question-info">Now in order to get your cup size you will need to do one more measurement. Pick which breast you think needs the most support. You will measure that side only by using one hand to hold the measuring tape in the middle of your back. You will then bring the tape to the middle of the front of your chest with your other hand. Make sure the tape remains parallel to the ground and is measuring the fullest part of your breast. Mark that measurement. This measurement is another tool we'll use to get the best support.</div>
        <i>If you measured all the way around your bust that's fine!</i><br>
