        <p>A bra size is usually shown as two numbers followed by a letter. The two numbers represent a band size and the letter represents a cup size. There are a few steps that we will take to get these values. Yes, calculations are involved. Yes, measurements are involved. These measurements are taken so you can find the bra size that will give you the most support. 
        <br><br>
        These measurements do not define how amazing you are or your value as a person (that value is uncalculateable because you are too awesome for numbers!).</p>
