            <h3 id="bra-wire-label">Wire or Wireless</h3>
            <div class="form-question-body">There are two ways that bra frames are held, either with wire(underwire) or without wire (wireless). Comfort surrounding this comes down to personal preferences and also the level of support that you want/need. Usually bras with wire give more support. Just like having an ethernet cable means you have a more reliable network connection, a bra with a wire means you will have more support. But wireless bras usually work just as well and provide flexibility of movement. Just like Wifi they can provide you the support you need, but may give an unreliable internet connection.</div>

            <h3 id="breast-shape-label">Breast shape</h3>
            <div class="form-question-body"> Frames of bras or shape of cups can also impact comfort and support. The three main types of frames are plunge, demi, and full.
            Comfort and support in regards to frames are determined by breast shape. Plunge line fits and supports any breast shape. Demi frames are more comfortable and give the best coverage and support for breast shapes that are more teardrop shaped. Full frames are more comfortable and give the best coverage and support for breast shapes that are round or are teardrop shaped but also a bit more round at the top.

            <h3 id="bra-padding-label">Padding</h3>
            <div class="form-question-body">Moving out from the frame is the level of padding of the bra. The main levels of padding are unlined, lightly-lined, and push-up. Unlined bras have no padding, and have one or two layers of cloth or lace. Lightly-lined bras have a small layer of padding, and have a layer of cloth or lace, then a layer of padding, and then a layer of cloth or lace. Push-up bras are similar to lightly-lined bras but have more padding in the lower half of the cup. Level of padding is also preference based but keep in mind that lightly-lined and push-up bras will give more support than unlined bras.</div>

            <h3 id="removable-pads-label">Removable Pads</h3>
            <div>
            When it comes to padding there are also bras that have removable pads. A bra with removable padding can be a great choice for many reasons. They will make push-up bras less pushupy (technical term). So you can take the removable pads out if you like the bra but want to have less push-up on one occasion and more push-up on another. You can put a nursing pad or a prosthetic in its place. They can also even things out. Let us be real: the majority of us are asymmetrical to some degree, meaning one breast is more full than the other. Whatever the reason, removable pads (which would also have space for adding more than just one pad) might be a great option. You can remove a pad from one cup and not use it or place it in the spot with the removable pad for the other cup.
            <br><br>
            Our bodies are amazing and you don't have to change a thing unless you want to- but if you want customization of padding these are great!

            <h3>Straps</h3>
            <div>
                Straps connect the cups from the front with the band in the back. They can help with support. The main types of strap configurations are t-back, racerback, classic back, and ballet back. T-back and Racerback are similar because instead of having two straps that go from each cup to each side of the band in the back they have two straps that go from each cup to the top of the back of the neck and then combine into one strap which then goes to the band. This can give a level of support to the bra and can be good for people with narrower shoulders. Classic back and ballet backs have two straps that go one from each cup to each side of the band in the back. These are good for any body type, especially people with broader shoulders. Your straps may be too loose if they keep falling off your shoulder down your arm, honey that isn't giving you any support! Tighten them up a little :) Bra straps also shouldn't dig too much into your skin. If your straps are uncomfortable and are digging into your skin it may mean you have the wrong bra size, or that another type of bra strap might be a good idea for you. Bras with thicker straps can help with this.

            <h3>Bands</h3>
            <div>
                The band runs from the middle of the back to the sides of the cups. There are two sections to most bands one section has a column of hooks on it another section has a few different columns of eyes on it (for the hooks to connect to). When you get a new bra always wear it on the loosest set of eyes (ones closest to the hooks to begin with). Bras will stretch over time so as it stretches you can set it to the middle set of eyes and then the tightest set of eyes (ones futherest from the hook to begin with). When you get to this set of eyes know that you may soon need a new bra, because the support of the band is wearing out. There are also bras that have smoothing fitting bands.
