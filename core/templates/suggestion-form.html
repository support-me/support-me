We also need to take into considerationa few things about bras that may impact how comfortabel you are in them. The main things to consider are: Breast shape and placement, level of padding in a bra, bra frame, and if you want a bra with underwire or do you want wifi (aka go wireless :) ).</div>

            <div class="form-question-body">First we need to understand the anatomy of the bra a little bit. In the drawing to the left you will notice a few parts of the bra are defined. As we go through the next steps we will talk more about theses specific parts of a the bra and how they can impact your comfort.</div>

            <div class="form-question-body">Let us go to the center and work our way outwords with the center gore. The center gore is the peice of the bra that connects the two cups together. A center gore that is wider will be more comfortable for people who breasts are placed further apart. A center gore that not only connects the cups but also connects along the bottom of the cups to the band will be comfortable for people who would like more support. </div>

            <h3 id="bra-wire-label">Wire or Wireless</h3>
            <div class="form-question-body">There are two ways that bra frames are held, either with wire(underwire) or without wire (wireless). Comfort surrounding this comes down to personal preferences and also the level of support that you want/need. Usually bras with wire give more support. Just like having an ethernet cable means you have a more reliable network, a bra with a wire means you will have more support. But wireless bras usually work just as well. Just like Wifi they can provide you the support you need but may give a bit spotty or unreliabel internet access if it is not built for the level of activity. Really it is up to you as to if you want underwire or not. </div>

            <h3 id="breast-shape-label">Breast shape</h3>
            <div class="form-question-body"> Frames of bras or shape of cups can also impact comfort and support. The three main types of frames are: Plunge, Demi, and Full. Comfort and support in regards to frames are determined by breast shape. Plunge line fits and supports any breast shape. Demi frames are more comfortable and give the best coverage and support for breast shapes that are more teardrop shaped.  Full frames are more comfortable and give the best coverage and support for breast shapes that are round or are teardrop shapped but also a bit more round at the top.  <breast_shape option></breast_shape></div>

            <h3 id="bra-padding-label">Padding</h3>
            <div class="form-question-body">Moving out from the frame is the level of padding of the bra. The mian levels of padding are unlined, lightly-lined, and push-up. Unlined bras have no padding, and have one or two layers of cloth or lace. Lightly-lined bras have a small layer of padding, and have a layer of cloth or lace, then a layer of padding, and then a layer of cloth or lace. Push-up bras are similar to lightly-lined bras but have more padding in the lower half of the cup. Level of padding is also preference based but keep in mind that lightly-lined and push-up bras will give more support than unlined bras.</div>

            <h3 id="removeable-pads-label">Removeable Pads</h3>
            <div>When it comes to padding there are also bras that have removeable pads. A bra with removable padding can be a great choice for many reasons. They will make push-up bras less pushupy. So you can take the removeable pads out if like the bra but want to have less push-up on one occasion and more push-up on another. They are great if you need to make more room. The plus about removeable pads is that well they can be removed. You can then put a nursing pad or a prosthetic in its place.They even things out. Let us be real: the majority of us are a little, or not a little asymmetrical, meaning one breast is more full than the other. It does not matter the reason, but if you want to even things out a bit a bra with space for removeable pads (which would also have space for adding more than just one pad) might be a good option. You can remove a pad from one cup and not use it or place it in the spot with the removeable pad for the other cup. Please know that your body is amazing the way it is and you don't have to change placement of pads if you dont want to.</div>

            <h3>Straps</h3>
            <div>
                Straps connect the cups from the front with the band in the back. They can help with support. The main types of strap configurations are t-back, racerback, classic back, ballet back. T-back and Racerback are similar because instead of having two straps that go from each cup to each side of the band in the back they have two straps that go from each cup to the top of the back for the neck and then combine into one strap which then goes to the band. This can give a level of support to the bra and can be good for people with narrower shoulders. Classic back and ballet backs have two straps that go one from each cup to each side of the band in the back. These are good for any body type, especially people with broader shoulders. Your straps may be too loose if they keep falling off your shoulder down your arm, honey that isnt giving you any support! Tighten them up a little :) Bra straps also shouldn't dig too much into your skin. If your straps are uncomfortable and are digging into your skin it may mean you have the wrong bra size, or that another type of bra strap might be a good idea for you. Bras with thicker straps can help with this.

            <h3>Bands</h3>
            <div>
                The band runs from the middle of the back to the sides of the cups. There are two sections to most bands one section has a column of hooks on it another section has a few differnt columns of eyes on it (for the hooks to connect to). When you get a new bra always wear it on the loosest set of eyes(ones closest to the hooks to begin with). Bras will stretch over time so as it stretches you can set it to a the middle set of eyes and then the tightest set of eyes(ones futherest from the hook to begin with). When you get to this set of eyes know that you may soon need a new bra, because the support of the band is wearing out. There are also bras that have smoothing fitting bands.
